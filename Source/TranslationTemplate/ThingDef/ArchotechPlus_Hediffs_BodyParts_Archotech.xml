  <!-- EN: The regenerator is a nearly mythical creation of the archotechs implanted in the sternum.

An internal sub-routine AI also begins manufacturing healing mechanites to release directly into the host's bloodstream upon detecting damage, promoting the rapid healing of wounds. This implant may be self-installed without any concern to the user.

Once installed, it cannot be removed. \n\nAn installed regenerator may be upgraded with an additional implant. Upon upgrading, the embedded AI will become fully functional and begin releasing more complex healing mechanites into the bloodstream that will heal long-term damage. It can even regenerate missing or destroyed limbs or organs over time, though it cannot respond quickly enough to prevent fatal damage should it occur quickly. \n\nA third and final upgrade gives the implant a larger mechanite capacity, reducing the time needed to heal wounds. Should fatal damage be incurred, the implant will release a burst of mechanites that will attempt to bring the user back to life, though this often takes hours or even days. \n\nThe materials and engineering behind this implant are far beyond normal human comprehension.\n\nSee the link below for In-Game effects: -->
